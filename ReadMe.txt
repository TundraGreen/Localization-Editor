Overview
--------
A system for maintaining a localization database. An application inserts "prompts" or "keys" where ever a language specific string is required. On execution, the application pulls the actual string in the appropriate language from the database. 

Localization Editor is a web app that makes it easy to create and maintain the database. It was particularly designed to facilitate multi-language web pages, but could be used anywhere support for various languages is desired. The maintenance of the text is completely separated from 
maintenance of the source code and can be done by translators with no knowledge of the source code.
 
The Editor uses php, javascript and ajax to manage the localization information which is stored in an sqlite database. The localized text strings are stored in a database. When an application needs a text string it is pulled from the data base using the prompt and language code as keys.

For example a web page would include the string:
<?php print local("hello_world") ?>
Where "local" is a function that queries the localization database using the string "hello_world" and a stored language cookie.

local might return "Hello World", or "Hola Mundo", or "Hallo Welt".

phpUtils.php
	A few php functions used by the Localization Editor
le.css
	The css used by the editor
le.js
	The javascript used by the editor
localization.sqlite
	A database containing
		Table of language-country pairs
		Table of prompts or keywords
		Table of text
addLanguage.php
	responds to an ajax call and adds a new language code
addPrompt.php
	responds to an ajax call and adds a new prompt
updateTranslation.php
	responds to an ajax call and modifies a stored localized text string
Cookie.php
	Checks for the presence of a language cookie
Several Apache ant build.xml and config files are included for zipping or pushing to a local web server.

Database structure

DROP TABLE languages;
CREATE TABLE languages
(
lid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
langcode TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
INSERT INTO languages (langcode) VALUES ("en_US");
INSERT INTO languages (langcode) VALUES ("es_MX");

DROP TABLE prompts;
CREATE TABLE prompts
(
pid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
promptstring TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
INSERT INTO prompts (promptstring) VALUES ("name");
INSERT INTO prompts (promptstring) VALUES ("address");

DROP TABLE translations;
CREATE TABLE translations
(
tid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
langid INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
promptid INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
langstring TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
INSERT INTO translations (langid, promptid, langstring) VALUES (1, 1, "Name");
INSERT INTO translations (langid, promptid, langstring) VALUES (2, 1, "Nombre");
INSERT INTO translations (langid, promptid, langstring) VALUES (1, 2, "Address");
INSERT INTO translations (langid, promptid, langstring) VALUES (2, 2, "Direcci&oacute;n");
