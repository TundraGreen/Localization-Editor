Overview
--------
A system for maintaining a localization database. An application inserts "prompts" or "keys" where ever a language specific string is required. On execution, the application pulls the actual string in the appropriate language from the database. 

Localization Editor is a web app that makes it easy to create and maintain the database. It was particularly designed to facilitate multi-language web pages, but could be used anywhere support for various languages is desired. The maintenance of the text is completely separated from 
maintenance of the source code and can be done by translators with no knowledge of the source code.
 
The Editor uses php, javascript and ajax to manage the localization information which is stored in an sqlite database. The localized text strings are stored in a database. When an application needs a text string it is pulled from the data base using the prompt and language code as keys.

For example a web page would include the string:
<?php print local("hello_world") ?>
Where "local" is a function that queries the localization database using the string "hello_world" and a stored language cookie.

local might return "Hello World", or "Hola Mundo", or "Hallo Welt".

2023-11-22
The Editor has been updated to handle multiple localization databases more smoothly. In the original implementation it operated on a single database location and it was up to the user to swap the databases around if there was more than one.

Now it stores the localization info in subfolders under a Databases folder. Each subfolder contains an sqlite file with the localization info. There is now a dropdown menu to allow switching between the options in Databases. In addition it is now possible to write all the translations strings to files, with one file for each language. This allows use of the localization with out any database calls. The user can just point the pages at the appropriate language. For US english, include the en_US.php file, for Spanish, the es_MX.php file. Each language file contains php define statements for all the prompts. To use them simply include the appropriate language file, then <?php print hello_world ?> will result in "Hello World" or "Hola Mundo" depending on which file has been included.

	The javascript used by the editor
localization.sqlite
	A database containing
		Table of language-country pairs
		Table of prompts or keywords
