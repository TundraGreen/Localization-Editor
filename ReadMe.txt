Overview
--------
A system for maintaining a localization database. An application inserts "prompts" or "keys" where ever a language specific string is required. On execution, the application pulls that actual string in the appropriate language from the database. 

Localization Editor is a web app that makes it easy to create and maintain the database. It was particularly designed to facilitate multi-language web pages, but could be used anywhere support for various languages is desired. The maintenance of the text is completely separated from 
maintenance of the source code and can be done by translators with no knowledge of the source code.
 
The Editor uses php, javascript and ajax to manage the localization information which is stored in an sqlite database. The text strings from the web pages are stored in a database. When the page is delivered to the user, php decides which language to pull from the database.

The text is included in the web page with a entry like:
<?php print local("hello_world") ?>
When the page is requested, the php looks up the string, "hello_world" in the database and returns, for example, either "Hello World", or "Hola a Mundo", or "Hallo Welt".
